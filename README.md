Inspired in the following video (https://goo.gl/3cdALa), dedicated specially to those asking for the source code in the video. Our clock is a little bit more special, beaultful, colorful, different and it rotates :-) !. My intention is to produce a 100% free open-source code to help people around the world struggling to learn C language and trying to make his 1st program on life.

I've made this video (https://goo.gl/QSXVmq) showing how the this compiled code works.

Whether you're a beginner of an experienced programmer, your suggestions are welcome.
