# clockFlavio
Inspired in the following video (https://goo.gl/3cdALa), dedicated specially in to the peoples at the video comments that was asking for the source code. Our clock is a little bit more special, our clock rotates :-) !. My intention is to produce a 100% free open-source code to help people around the world struggling to learn C and trying to make his 1st program on life happens.

My best regards
