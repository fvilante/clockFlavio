# clockFlavio
Inspired in following video (https://goo.gl/3cdALa), especially in the peoples on the video comments asking for the source code I develop this source. Our clock is a little bit, let's say crasy :-) !. My intention is to produce a 100% free source code to help people around the world struggling to learn C and trying to make his 1st program.
